Comments modules add discussion capabilities to your pages.

From the administration area, you can enable a comment provider that work best for you.
Most modules require some configuration. Check out the links below for module specific configuration instructions.

# Enable Comments

The **Comments** feature must be enabled under **Administration > General** before you can start using comments.

# Modules

- [Commento](/comments/commento)
- [Default](/comments/default)
- [Disqus](/comments/disqus)
{.links-list}

# Permissions

> This only applies to the **Default** module.
>
> External modules like Commento or Disqus are not tied to any group permissions or internal users. Moderation and authentication is handled by the module provider.
{.is-warning}

The ability to read, post or manage comments is controlled via group permissions.

Ensure the group the user is member of has both the global permission and the page rule assigned to perform the desired comment action.
