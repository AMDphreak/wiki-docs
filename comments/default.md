This is the default, built-in commenting module for Wiki.js

# Setup

1. In the **Administration Area** of your wiki, click on **Comments** in the left navigation.
1. Click on **Default**.
1. Click **Apply** on the upper right of the page to save and apply the configuration.

The built-in comments UI will now be displayed at the end of all your wiki pages.

# Askimet

New comments can optionally be verified against the Askimet service. This is the same service used by Wordpress to prevent and block spam comments.

In order to use it, you need to create a free account on https://akismet.com/ and get an **API key**.
