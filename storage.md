Storage modules allows for simple content backup and synchronization.

All content is stored in the database. However, you may want to save that content in various locations as well. You can enable any of the storage modules below to do so.

Some modules are also capable to synchronizing content in both directions (such as Git). This allows for content to be created and modified in other applications and still be available in Wiki.js.
